Please do not delet the scramble.jsx file in this directory, that is directly linked with the working of gallery.jsx
in the localhost/gallery.

the scramble directory is associated with the effects the scramble.jsx contains. 
call <ScrambleText> text </ScrambleText> from within the "components/scramble/Scramble.jsx" to use the water gliding 
effect as in localhost/gallery anywhere on the page!

please rename the directory/file if needed! as per your convenience and edit this readme

Thankyou!
